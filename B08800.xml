            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, that I, at ſuch a diſtance from you, and not of your nation, ſhould trouble my ſelf ſo much about your eſtate, being a people now deſpicable in the worlds eyes, ſcattered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed among the nations; and upon a rational account unlikely to be a people beloved for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſake, and that ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of God when the nations ſhall fall before you, and confeſs you a people ſought out and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not forſaken: but I have had ſeveral prevailing arguments in mine own heart, which have occaſioned me to preſent you with this Epiſtle, and I intreat and beſeech you for the Lords ſake, and for the love of the truth, that you do read this Epiſtle, and ponder it well in your hearts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the God of Grace to give you an underſtanding in the truth herein preſented to you,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:184883:4"/> for with much bowels of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love, have I written to you: the reaſons moving me thereunto are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That cleer diſcovery God hath given me by his Spirit from the Word of truth of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do you good; and that although you have been a long time rejected and ſcattered for your own ſake, yet you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and ſhall be gathered for the Fathers ſake.</p>
               <p>Secondly, being thus inſtructed in the truth of your calling, it lay much as a duty upon my heart (and I am confident from the Lord) to write unto you; that I might perform my duty to you in my generation, leaving the bleſſing to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Likewiſe being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the time of your gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is at hand.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, knowing likewiſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:184883:5"/> that your fullneſs will be the time of the deliverance of all believing Gentiles, now diſperſed and trampled under foot for their Lords ſake; for he was given to be a light to the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and laſt, I finde it to be the deſire of <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> in his book titled, <hi>The hope of Iſrael,</hi> in his Epiſtle to the Reader, That if any to whom his book came, had any thing worthy of poſterity, that they would give him notice of it. I have not here preſented you with any thing of Hiſtory or outward learning, but have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored, according to the grace received, in the plain evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit and power of truth, to preſent you with ſuch things, as may, through the bleſſing of God, tend to your eternal good.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:184883:5"/>
               <p> The firſt principle of truth I have to preſent you with, is, that the true and promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was, according to the counſel of God, to ſuffer death for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of ſinners; and this I ſhall clear unto you, by convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing grounds from the Scriptures, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets, whom you know and own; and my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire for you at the throne of grace, is, that the God of grace may give you an underſtanding in the knowledge of this truth. This I ſhall confirm unto you from three grounds. 1. Promiſes, 2. Types, 3. Propheſies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Is that Promiſe of grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and hers; it ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> This promiſe hath a ſpecial relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and clearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with his ſuffering, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:184883:6"/> by his death he ſhould break the Serpents head <hi>(viz.)</hi> the head of Satan; though he himſelf were bruiſed, though he ſuffered in the fleſh, yet he ſhould overcome in ſuffering. I do not deny, but that this hath been and is accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all that truely know the Lord: Satan, ſin, and evil men oppoſe, but the ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath and will bruiſe the head of all, in and for his people, though he himſelf was appointed to be bruiſed by the Serpents ſeed, to this agreeth <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>He was bruiſed for our iniquitiès,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſee it clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented in types and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; firſt the Paſchal Lambe or Paſſeover, mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. was a lively repreſentation of the crucifying of the Lamb of God, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> who was to come, and by his blood to make attonement and peace for ſinners, that as the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:184883:6"/> children of Iſrael were then made partakers of a deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by that means the killing of a Lamb, eating the fleſh, and ſprinkling the door-poſt with the blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo muſt the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> give his life and blood for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his people (out of ſpiritual <hi>Egypt,</hi> darkneſs &amp; oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) both of Jews and Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the ſacrifices &amp; offerings by the Prieſts commanded in the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> were clear types and repreſentations of the ſufferings of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> the offering of Lambs, &amp; Rams, &amp; Bullocks; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be ſin-offerings, burnt-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and peace-offerings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all preſentations of Chriſt the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in Engliſh the anointed, who was to be the alone peace and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering for his people; the Prieſt was to offer ſacrifice for ſin, as is expreſt at large, <hi>Levit.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 Chapters, and Chap. 16. 34.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:184883:7"/> they were to make an attonement once a yeer, both for themſelves and the people. All theſe offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings could not do away ſin, but as it had a relation to the true offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that was to offer himſelf once for all, that he might by one offering for ever perfect them that were by him ſanctified: this truth you ſhall ſee when the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the veil that is ſpread over your faces, that clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe offerings is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the offering up of the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> once for all, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This truth is likewiſe clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propheſied, that he that runs may read. There is ſcarce any prophet of God, but did foreſee and foretell of this truth, the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the <hi>Meſſiah.

See likewiſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 53. throughout, deſcribing the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> that he was wounded and bruiſed, rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with griefs, and that God laid upon him the iniquity of us all. And <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>They ſhall look upon him whom they have peirced:</hi> all which confirms the truth, that the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> which you look for, was to come forth, firſt in his humiliation, in contempt, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>I deſire to mind you of one thing by the way, before I come to the confirmation of the truth aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> that the true and promiſed <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> was, according to the Scripture, to have his day and time of humiliation, as hath been already proved, and then his glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 6. firſt a childe, a ſon, and then a King, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be upon his ſhoulders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chap. 53. throughout till the laſt ver. he is preſented in his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering eſtate; and in the laſt verſ. in his reign: <hi>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoile with the strong.</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:184883:9"/> To this agrees that of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25, 26. <hi>Oh fools and ſlow of heart to believe that which the prophets have written, ought not Christ to have ſuffered theſe things, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his glory?</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 10, 11, 12. the ſuffering part, as in relation to himſelf in his own perſon, he hath paſſed through, and is entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Though while the Church is under ſuffering, yet as he is conſidered one with his Church, the time of his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is not over till all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are glorified with him.</p>
               <p>Now that this is the true Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will appear, if you conſider, 1. That in him was fulfilled all the legall types that did repreſent him in his ſufferings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he it was that is the true Paſcal Lamb, or rather the Lamb repreſented in the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.

For if the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the aſhes of an heifer, ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying

For Chriſt is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are figures of the true, but into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, now to appear in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:184883:10"/> preſence of God for us, <hi>&amp;c.

By all which it appears that he is the true and promiſed Meſſiah, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in him is fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the figures and ſhadows of the old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>It will farther appear that this is the true Meſſiah, if you conſider how fully in him is anſwered all the propheſies and promiſes of him in the old Teſtament in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his humiliation; and in him ſhall be fulfilled all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his glory, but every thing in its order that God hath ſet it. 1. For his humiliation, ſee what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:184883:11"/> the Prophet <hi>David</hi> perſonating Chriſt, as it might be very well (for ſometimes Chriſt is called <hi>David, Ezek.</hi> 39. 24, 25. and the promiſe made with <hi>David</hi> and his ſeed, hath a ſpeciall relation to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. from the 19. to the 39. verſ.) ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. the prophet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonating Chriſt in his ſufferings, you may clearly ſee Chriſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering thoſe things, or all thoſe things fully anſwered in him: in way of complaint, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. I a worm and no man, this was the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. All they that ſee me, laugh me to ſcorn; ſo it was fulfilled in Jeſus, <hi>Mat,</hi> 27. 29, 30 31. and when they had plated a crown of thornes (in reproach) they put it on his head and a reed in his right hand, and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him and ſaid, <hi>Haile King of the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 8. he truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lord, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

For dogs have compaſſed me, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the wicked have enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me; they have peirced my hands and my feet: and this was fulfilled in him, as is clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>John</hi> 20. 24, 25. and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> one of the Twelve ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will not believe. Again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 17. they part my garments among them, and caſt lots upon (or for) my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and this was fulfilled in Chriſt.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:184883:12"/> 14. the Lord by the prophet <hi>(Ahaz</hi> refuſing to ask a ſigne) gives him a ſigne: <hi>Behold a virgin ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his name Emmanuel:</hi> this cannot be rightly intended or underſtood but of Chriſt the true Meſſiah. For firſt, never a virgin conceived a child in the ordinary courſe of nature. And ſecondly, his name Immanuel, <hi>viz.</hi> God with us; could not properly be given to any but the Son of God, nor ever was there a virgin that bear a Son, but <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> or any one, beſides him truly called Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel, that is, God with us, and with his, believing in him, by his ſpirit and grace, &amp; ſhall be with his in glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 26, &amp;c. here in is the myſtery of Gods wiſdom &amp; grace to men; that as by a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin and condemnation came firſt into the world; ſo by a Son born of a woman, a virgin, ſalvation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:184883:12"/> is come into the world.</p>
               <p>As his conception and birth was according to the Scripture of a virgin, ſo the place of his birth was according to propheſies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem, Mic.</hi> 5. 2. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 1, 5. and for this reaſon it was that <hi>Herod</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the males in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the coaſts thereof from two yeers old and under to be ſlain, that ſo he might make ſure to ſlay Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 16. and this makes way for the fulfilling of another propheſie, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 15. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 17, 18. Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the prophet, ſaying, In <hi>Ramah</hi> was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, <hi>Rachel</hi> weeping for her children and would not be comforted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not: though I do not queſtion but that there may be much in this propheſie relating
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:184883:13"/> to the diſtreſſed eſtate of Iſrael, and afterward a propheſie of their return. But it was likewiſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in this alſo, for <hi>Benjamin</hi> came of <hi>Rachel, Gen.</hi> 35. 18. and <hi>Ramah</hi> was one part of <hi>Benjamins</hi> poſſeſſion, <hi>Nehe.</hi> 11. 33. and the fulfilling of this Scripture made way for the fulfilling of another propheſie, <hi>Joſeph</hi> at the command of God flying with Jeſus into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to ſave his life from <hi>Herod,</hi> made way for the fulfilling of that propheſie, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. Out of <hi>Egypt</hi> have I called my Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 15. he was there, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> until the death of <hi>Herod,</hi> that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken of the Lord by the prophet, ſaying, out of <hi>Egypt</hi> have I called my Son. Its true, there might be ſomething in it relating to your coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but propheſies are of a large extent, and the moſt precious myſtery is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:184883:13"/> hid from our eyes, if the Lord open not our underſtanding.</p>
               <p>His life was a life of ſuffering aſſoon as he came into the world, his life was ſought after, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he was the reproach of men, accounted a friend to Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners, a blaſphemer, one that caſt out divels through <hi>Belzebub</hi> the Prince of divels, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24. <hi>John</hi> 10. 33. and ſo in him was fulfilled that propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 18. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13. Behold I and the children which the Lord hath given me, are for ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in Iſrael. He came to his own, and his own received him not, and ſo that propheſie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. Who hath believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? and that propheſie <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 9. Go tell this people, hear ye in hearing, but underſtand not, and ſee in deed, but perceive not. Make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:184883:14"/> the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eys leſt they hear with their ears, and ſee with their eyes, and underſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and I ſhould heal them. And hath not this been your condition many yeers? and hath not there been a forſaking in the land upon this account, and the Lord hath removed you far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? but there is a tenth which ſhall return, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>And in him was fulfilled that propheſie <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. 9. Rejoyce great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, O daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> ſhout O daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Behold thy King cometh to thee, he is juſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſalvation, lowly, and riding upon an Aſs, and upon a Colt, the fole of an Aſs. This was fulfilled in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 5. to the 10. this was done that it might be fulfilled which was ſpoken by the Prophet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:184883:14"/> ſaying Behold thy King cometh unto thee meekly, ſitting upon an Aſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Note, this was an act of Chriſt to be performed in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation he muſt come lowly, meekly riding upon an Aſs; this is not to be expected in his glory, then he ſhall come in power and great glory. Who will abide the day of his coming? and who will ſtand when he appeareth? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. But firſt he muſt come meekly and humbly; and yet riding in this meek eſtate; wherein was a reſemblance of his glory; the great multitudes that went before and followed after him cryed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hoſanna to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> bleſſed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Hoſanna in the higheſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 9. if there was ſo much glory appeared in his meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his humiliation, how will he appear glorious when he ſhall appear in his power, when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:184883:15"/> the ſong of Saints ſhall be, the Lord God omnipotent reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>With what clearneſs was that propheſie fulfilled in all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of it? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14 &amp; cha. 53. throughout, Cha. 52. 14. as many were aſtoniſhed at thee, his viſage was ſo marred more than any mans, and his form more than the ſons of men. Was not this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled when your fathers cryed out crucifie him, crucifie him, give us not this man but <hi>Barabbas? Mat.</hi> 27. 20, 21. Jeſus was ſo marred in their eyes, that they preferred <hi>Barabbas</hi> a thief and a murderer before him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 14, 15. thus was he a man of ſorrows and acquainted with griefs, deſpiſed &amp; rejected of men, and not eſteemed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chap. 53. 3. Oh was not this propheſie fulfilled to the life in Jeſus? <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. Surely he hath born our griefs, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſorrows, yet we did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:184883:15"/> him ſtriken, ſmitten of God and afflicted; but he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reaſon was in <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. Becauſe that all we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, and he bare our ſins on his own body on the croſs, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. In him was fulfilled that ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 1. They ſhall ſmite the Judge of Iſrael with the rod upon the cheek, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 30. They ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and took the reed and ſmote him on the head, and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 6. I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpiting.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:184883:16"/>
               <p> Thus was he numbered among tranſgreſſors, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 12. accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſe than <hi>Barabbas</hi> cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied between two thieves, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 27, 28. and the Scripture was fulfilled. In all which he fulfilled that ſaying <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 7. he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and as a ſheep before her ſhearer is dumb, ſo opened he not his mouth, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 62, 63. And thus in ſilence for the ſins of men he ſuffered death, even the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death of the Croſs: and that Scripture was fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 8. He was cut off out of the land of the living for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he cut off, and verſe 9. he made his grave with the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and verſ. 12. he pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out his ſoul to the death, and he was numbered with the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors for he bear the ſins of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:184883:16"/> Thus have I given you a brief taſt of this truth ſo neceſſary to be known in this day of grace, that Jeſus Chriſt is the true promiſed Meſſiah. The Lord give you an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in this precious truth, which in it ſelf is ſo full of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that whoſoever runs may read if the vail remain not ſtill untaken away.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add in the laſt place, that he according to the Scripture came of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſo was the Son of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh; and in him were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies fulfilled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. The ſcepter ſhall not depart from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> nor the law-giver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his feet till <hi>Shilo</hi> come, and to him ſhall the gathering of the people be. And that propheſie <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 1. And there ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtem of <hi>Ieſſe;</hi> and a branch ſhall grow out of his roots, with <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 22, 23. I have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:184883:17"/> found <hi>David</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ieſſe</hi> a man after mine own heart which ſhall fulfill all my wil, of this mans ſeed hath God according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe raiſed a Saviour Jeſus, and this is proved both by <hi>Matthew,</hi> Chap. 1. and <hi>Luk.</hi> chap. 3. in their account of the genealogy of Chriſt both agree in their account that he was the Son of <hi>David,</hi> though probably there may ſeem ſome ſcruple, becauſe they reckon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a contrary line, yet I do believe there is much of the wiſdome of God in it: <hi>Matthew</hi> reckoning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the genealogy of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who was the ſuppoſed father of Chriſt, and <hi>Luke</hi> after the line of <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Chriſt; ſo that take it on which ſide you will, both came of <hi>David,</hi> and ſo Chriſt was the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> and the ſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Mat. 1. 1. and ſo he was acknowledged in his incarnation by all that had any convictions of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:184883:17"/> heart upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 27. The two blind men cryed, Thou ſon of <hi>David</hi> have mercy on us, and the woman of Canaan, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 22. Cryed, ſaying, have mercy on me, O Lord thou ſon of <hi>David,</hi> and Chap. 21. 9. the multitude cryed out Hoſanna to the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> &amp;c. Let this ſuffice, he was the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> he was made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the fleſh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of holineſs, by the reſurrection from the dead, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3. 4. For he did not only dy for our ſins, but he was alſo raiſed again for our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, according to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. and ſo that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture was fulfilled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſee corruption. <hi>David</hi> ſaw corruption, but this man ſaw no corruption, being quickened and raiſed by the Spirit, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 6.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:184883:18"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 and being riſen, he is aſcended to the Father, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 17. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9, 10. And the heavens muſt receive him till the time of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. Thus much ſhall ſuffice at preſent in confirmation of this truth, that that man Jeſus who was crucified at Jeruſalem is the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah, though I might give many grounds more, as the wiſe men coming by a ſtar from the Eaſt to Jeruſalem, ſaying, where is he that is born King of the Jews? together with the many and great miracles which he did? as to turn water into wine? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. heal the ſick? open the eys of the blind? raiſe the dead? preach ed with authority, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake like this, by the confeſſion of thoſe that were ſent to apprehend him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 46. Thus his works do witneſs that he was the ſon of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 36. and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:184883:18"/> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> was a witneſs to him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 15. &amp; 5. 33. the father by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bare witneſs to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 37. all his diſciples and ſervants were witneſſes to him in their cleaving to him, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his name, though in a way of ſuffering; the Sun being darkened in the day of his ſufferings, was an evident wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that he was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 45. the rending of the veil of the temple, and raiſing of the dead, and quaking of the earth, convincing witneſſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 51, &amp;c. that he was the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And finally, your being caſt out of your own country amongſt the nations, your City and temple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, according to his word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 2. for your rejecting of him according to that parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 33. 38. 41.

               <p>THe third general truth I deſire to preſent you with, is, that the rejecting of this Jeſus hath been and is your ſin, and that its your duty to own him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. I ſay unto you as once the Meſſiah ſaid unto your fathers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 24. If ye believe not that I am he, you ſhall dye in your ſins.

               <p n="1">1. The meaneſs of his condition in outward appearance. Oh you looked for him to come in glory, a King to deliver you from all your enemies. Oh you did not, you do not know the myſtery of his humiliation; it was hid from your eyes; it was hid from his

               <p n="2">2. The meaneſs of his followers, Oh they were too mean for ſuch a preſence as was ſuppoſed would attend the true Meſſiah, hence it was (I will not ſay and yet is, your ſelves beſt know) that the chief Prieſts and Phariſees ſaid, have any of the rulers or of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees believed on him? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7. 48.

I ſay unto you as once <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. be it known unto you, that through this man is preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Oh do not contradict and blaſpheme any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for he is ſtill good and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the arms of his mercy are yet open to receive you; he is not yet riſen up out of his holy habitation to take vengeance on his enemies; but he is yet complaining, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 4. Then I ſaid, I have labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain, I have ſpent my ſtrength for nought and in vain; yet ſurely my judgement is with the Lord, and my work is with my God: Behold Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining for the rebellion of his
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:184883:21"/> nation, as if he had ſpent his labor in vain, ſuffered in vain, becauſe of their long rejecting of him; but ſee the anſwer of God unto him to comfort him in his ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. And he ſaid, art thou ligher then that thou ſhouldeſt be my ſervant to raiſe up the tribes of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and to reſtore the reſtored of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (and till <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee, and is gathered by thee, for thy comfort) I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth: thus ſaith the Lord the redeemer of Iſrael, Iſrael ſhall be redeemed with judgement, and her converts with righteouſneſs. Oh therefore ſtand it not out with the Lord any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for if ye will not believe, ye ſhall not be eſtabliſhed; the way by which God will work your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, will be your owning of the holy child Jeſus, he it is that muſt be your peace, and that by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:184883:21"/> faith in his blood, for he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his life a ranſom for many to be teſtified in due time, and that propheſie <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and ſhal mourn for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he it is that was peirced by your fathers, and by your ſelves too, in ſo much as you have juſtified your fathers in their ſin, by your rejecting of him, and that opinion will prove but a fancy mentioned in <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> his book page 33. Sect. 26. that ſome of your wiſe men ſay, that there is Meſſiah the ſon of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and that he ſhall dye in the laſt war of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and do apply this Scripture to that, they ſhall look upon me whom they have peirced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This cannot be for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is never but one Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah ſpoken of in the Scriptures, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 25, 26. and that Meſſiah is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:184883:22"/> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and he was to be cut off, but not for himſelf but for men.</p>
               <p>Second Reaſon, Becauſe the cuting off of the Meſſiah was to be after the building of the City <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in their coming out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and before the ſecond deſtruction by <hi>Titus,</hi> expreſſed in theſe words, that from the going forth of the commandment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore and build <hi>Ieruſalem (viz.</hi> in coming forth of <hi>Babylon)</hi> unto Meſſiah the prince, ſeven weeks, that is ſeven times ſeventy weeks, and the ſeventy weeks is ſeventy times ſeven weeks, which is all one in computation of time, then the Meſſiah was to be cut off, and after <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> deſtroyed again by the people of the Prince that ſhall come, for the <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> was not then in being, but was to come ſo that it cannot be ſo underſtood that Meſſiah ſhould be cut off in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:184883:22"/> the laſt war of <hi>Gog,</hi> becauſe he was to be cut off before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be underſtood ſo, becauſe that word in <hi>Zachariah,</hi> clears it ſelf; he doth not ſay <hi>Gog</hi> &amp; <hi>Magog</hi> ſhall look on him whom they have peirced; ſo it muſt be if he were to be ſlain by <hi>Gog,</hi> but I will pour upon the houſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and upon the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the ſpirit of Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they ſhall look upon him whom they have peirced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was peirced by you, and you it is that ſhall look upon him and mourn, when the Lord doth pour out the ſpirit of Grace upon you.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It cannot be in the laſt war of <hi>Magog,</hi> for then ſhall be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to any but <hi>Gog</hi> himſelf, for there are two deſtructions to <hi>Gog,</hi> as in its place I ſhall make it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:184883:23"/> appear. Oh therefore be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit down a little, and ſadly conſider your eſtate. If this be truth, which is undeniable, that the true Meſſiah was according to propheſies to ſuffer, and all things ſpoken of by the prophets was fulfilled in him, and ſo it appears that he was, and is indeed the Son of God, King of Iſrael, Is it not high time for you to awake out of ſleep? Doth not the Lord ſay by the Prophet, that there is a veil &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering caſt over all people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 7. And <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. that the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the reading of <hi>Moſes</hi> law remaineth untaken away. When that is taken away, you ſhall ſee him to be the ſubſtance, as hath been minded, of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, Prieſt ſacrifice, attonement, prophet, and king, and to him you will ſubmit in all things; Do you believe the Prophets? I know you believe them: Oh then deſire the Lord
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:184883:23"/> that you may underſtand them, that you may not remain in that eſtate, that Chriſt being come, you do not know him; it was want of knowledge that was the cauſe why your fathers crucified him, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. had they known, they would not have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of glory. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not in that ſin of ignorance and unbelief; I know you ſhall not long. I do rejoyce in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your zeal againſt idolatry, Images &amp; Pictures; in your keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to your own people in your marriages, by which you are preſerved in your great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Meſſiah: but Oh my ſoul longs that you might know him in his humiliation, that ſo you might ſuffer with him, and for him, and reign with him, that you might know who it is you look for, one that hath ſuffered and been tempted, that ſo he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:184883:24"/> might be your king in his humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, a little, before he come in his glory. Oh it will be your joy and crown of rejoycing one day, if you have hearts to own him truly in his humiliation. Well, your duty is, and its that which the Lord calls you to, to repent and believe the Goſpel, to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized after believing, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, wherein is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the waſhing away of ſin both in conſcience and converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through faith in his blood; its onely the duty of believers to be baptized; we own no national Church under the Goſpel (before the day of Chriſts glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing) but whoſoever liveth and believeth in him ſhall be ſaved; the nations delude themſelves with the form of godlineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power; Oh its the life and power of godlineſs that will ſtand us inſtead at the laſt: its
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:184883:24"/> your duty to own him in every part of his word and will, for God hath raiſed him up a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to you; and its your duty to hear him in all, <hi>Dcut.</hi> 18. 15. with <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>Moſes</hi> gives up all to him, if <hi>Moſes</hi> were upon the earth he would willingly ſubmit himſelf to this prophet; therefore ſtand it not out with him, remember that word of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 27. but thoſe mine enemies that would not that I ſhould reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, bring hither and ſlay them before me. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his glorious appearing will render vengeance to them that know him not, to them that obey him not, but will be admired in all thoſe that have believed in him: in that day, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 8. 9, 10. Oh therefore fear and tremble to ſtand it out with him any longer, he is that ſtone, that whoſoever falls on him will be broken, but
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:184883:25"/> on whomſoever he ſhall fall, he will break them to pieces: you have been ſtumbling at him a long time.</p>
               <p>Oh take heed leſt he fall on you, he is not onely a Lamb full of meekneſs, patience and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſlain for the ſin of ſinners, but he is the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and when the Lyon roareth all the beaſts of the Foreſt will then tremble, Oh then bleſſed are all thoſe that put their truſt in him.</p>
               <p>To conclude this word, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I beſſech you theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That without him there is no life, there is no other name gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven among men, whereby you may be ſaved, but by the name of Jeſus, <hi>viz.</hi> through faith in his blood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the grievouſneſs of your ſin, in rejecting him ſo long
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:184883:25"/> as you have, conſider of that word of the Prophet, if it had been an enemy I could have born it, but it is thou O man my acquaintance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. it is his own, and they have not received him. Oh thats it will cauſe you to weep bitterly every family apart, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. when you ſhall come to look upon him whom you have peirced, and ſhall mourn for him. Oh its that will break your hearts, when you ſhall ſee and ſay, he that is our king hath been our reproach; we it is that have wounded and peirced him, we it is that have rejected him, and trampled him under our feet, and accounted the blood of the covenant an holy thing; yet know, that if the Lord make you ſenſible of your ſin, he is gracious, he is yet a Lamb full of meekneſs, &amp; his blood ſhall cleanſe you from all your ſins; for the promiſe is to you as many as the Lord our God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:184883:26"/> ſhall call. For this cauſe he is the Mediator of the New Teſtament, that by means of death for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the tranſgreſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your rejecting of him, yet he ſhall be your King at laſt, and he it is that ſhall be manifeſt to be the Lord of lords, and King of kings, that one Lord Jeſus Chriſt who hath been ſo much ſet light by you, ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 10. I will be thy King, Where is any that may ſave thee in all thy Cities? and this leads me to the fourth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>

               <p>THe fourth particular that I ſhall preſent you with, is that this Jeſus ſhall reign on earth and the twelve Tribes of Iſrael ſhall be gathered by him to their own land in peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Jeſus ſhall have his kingdom and dominion here on earth manifeſt among the ſons of men. Having had his day of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation among the ſons of men, He ſhall have his day of glory on earth among the ſons of men, that as he hath been abaſed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on earth, ſo ſhall he in perſon reign on earth. In the confirmation of this glorious truth, I ſhall preſent you with many Scriptures both in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. throughout. Where the Lord hath ſaid it, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:184883:27"/> the heathen rage, and the people imagin a vain thing, for they imagine that Chriſt ſhall not reign, which is a vain thing, vain imaginations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet verſe 6. Have I ſet my King upon the holy hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> And verſe 8. He ſhall have the heathen given him for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion; &amp; what ſhall he do with them? he ſhall break them with a rod of iron, and daſh them in pieces like a potters veſſel. This is a clear propheſie of the reign of Chriſt the anointed. I have ſet mine anointed upon <hi>Zion</hi> the hill of my holineſs; and all the rage of men on earth ſhall not hinder it, or prevent God in his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of the exaltation of the man Jeſus; to this fully agreeth that glorious propheſie, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 72. throughout though it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the Prophet in this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:184883:27"/> Pſalm intendeth <hi>Solomon,</hi> which I do not altogether deny, yet he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth <hi>Solomon</hi> no otherwiſe than as he was a type of Chriſt, but in the Meſſiah, the man Jeſus, ſhall this propheſie be truly and fully made good in the day of his glory, verſ. 2. He ſhall judge thy people with righteouſneſs and thy poor with judgement, verſ. 4. He ſhall judge the poor of the people, and ſhall ſave the children of the needy and ſhall break in pieces the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor, verſ. 5. they ſhall fear thee ſo long as the Sun and Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth throughout all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This was never made good in <hi>Solomon,</hi> nor in any man elſe, but it ſhall be in Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him; but to return, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. in his dayes the righteous ſhall flouriſh, and abundance of peace, till there be no Moon, verſ. 8. he ſhall have dominion alſo from ſea to ſea, and from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:184883:28"/> the river unto the ends of the earth, and ſo to the 17. verſe are many glorious propheſies of his kingdom, and his name ſhall be for ever; he ſhall be a ſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his fathers name for ever; and men ſhall be bleſſed in him, all nations ſhall call him bleſſed, Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who onely doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bleſſed be his glorious name for ever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory, Amen, Amen. So likewiſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 8. after the deſcription of Magiſtrates, what they ſhould be, and what they ſhould do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the poor and fatherleſs, do juſtice to the afflicted and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then what they did judge, unjuſtly, and accept the perſons of the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Prophet ſeeing no juſtice to be done by men, what ever

               <p>The Lord will firſt, to ſhew that he is gracious, ſave <hi>Iudah</hi> firſt, called the tents of <hi>Iudah,</hi> becauſe the two tribes known by that name, live as it were in tents, not ſo poſſeſſed of any Nation as to call it their own.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, he will ſave the tents of <hi>Iudah</hi> firſt, thar the glory of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the glory of the inhabitants of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> do not magnifie againſt <hi>Iudah,</hi> not but that <hi>Iudah</hi> is the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> but the glory of it will be the coming in of the ten tribes ſo long loſt, that will be the glory of the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that is of Chriſt, but the tents of <hi>Iudah</hi> muſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:184883:33"/> be firſt, that the ten tribes may not magnifie againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had a hand in the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their king, they it were that ſaid, this is the heir, come let us kill him, but <hi>Iſrael</hi> was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this.</p>
               <p>Therefore to prevent <hi>Iſraels</hi> magnifying againſt <hi>Iudah,</hi> the Lord will ſave the Tents of <hi>Iudah</hi> firſt: behold the riches of his grace, and kindneſs to men: this is one prevailing thing that hath at this time drawn forth my heart and pen in writing to you.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, He will ſave the ten tribes and bring them to their own land, who have been for a long time driven far away, yet not ſo properly ſaid to dwel in tents as <hi>Iudah,</hi> becauſe I do believe that they are not onely in being, but that there are great and ſtrong na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them; as for the many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:184883:33"/> places mentioned by <hi>Menaſſeh Ben Iſrael,</hi> of their habitation, I am not ſo curious about it, it is enough to me to know that they are, and that they ſhall return when their day is come. I do give much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to that mentioned by you in 2 <hi>Eſdra</hi> 13. their being paſſed through the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> into a ſtrange land, where never man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind dwelt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that there they ſhall remain till the latter day, and then the Lord will work ſigns for them, and return them the ſame way, and will drie up the river again for them to paſſe through; and to this agreeth that propheſie in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 11. when the Lord ſhall ſet his hand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to recover the remnant that are left from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c. then <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. the Lord ſhall utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the tongue of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſea, and with his mighty wind ſhall he ſhake his hand over the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:184883:34"/> and ſhall ſmite it in the ſeven ſtreams, and make men go over in ſhoos, and <hi>v.</hi> 16. there ſhall be a high way for them that are left from <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> &amp;c. that is the ten Tribes that was carried away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by <hi>Salmanazer</hi> king of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> where <hi>Euphrates</hi> is called the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> ſea, in way of alluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall be like, as it was to Iſrael in the day that he came up out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> verſ. 16. to this agreeth that in <hi>Zach.</hi> 10. 11. and he ſhall paſs through the ſea with affliction, and ſhall ſmite the waves in the ſea, and all the deeps of the river ſhall drie up, and the pride of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ſhall be brought down (becauſe <hi>Aſſyria</hi> carried them away) and the Scepter of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall depart: now the reaſon why <hi>Egypt</hi> is ſo much ſpoken of and the return from <hi>Egypt.</hi> I do judge is, becauſe there was a remnant that was not carryed
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:184883:34"/> captive into <hi>Baylon,</hi> but went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> Jer. 43. 5, 6, 7. and I have not read of their return, but its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that they might be driven away into ſome obſcure place, and ſhall undoubtedly return at the time appointed. But to return, to this agreeth that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. And the ſixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the Eaſt might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Doubtleſs the ten Tribes are in all this time of their being in the unknown parts of the world grown into many kingdoms and great people, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in through the river <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> will be a great amazement to the world; thus ſhall both <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> be gathered to their own country under Chriſt the head of his Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that propheſie ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:184883:35"/> 37. 16. <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhall be both writen on one ſtick, and ſhall become one, and ſhall have one king, even <hi>David</hi> (that is Chriſt) ſhall be their prince for ever, and he ſhall make a covenant of peace for them, and they ſhall be no more two; the envy of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall depart, and the adverſaries of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall be cut off, <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall not envy <hi>Iudah,</hi> nor <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhal not vex <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Iſa. 11. 13. this is that which the Lord hath ſaid, that though thy bruiſe be incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and thy wound grievous, yet the Lord will reſtore health, and will heal thee of thy wounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Jer. 30. thus ſhall <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be inhabited again in her own place, even in <hi>Ieruſalem, Zach.</hi> 12. 6. I ſhall ſay no more to this at preſent, beeauſe I finde <hi>Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael</hi> ſo full of clearneſs in this part of the truth, and I do perceive by his lines your earneſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:184883:35"/> expectation of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this great ſalvation by the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> which is indeed my joy; but Oh that your ſouls did know him and believe in him, who will appear for your joy; and as for the time, I dare not pitch upon it, becauſe I believe, as is mentioned in the hope of Iſrael, the Lord hath reſerved it to himſelf. So Chriſt anſwered his diſciples, Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no not the angels of heaven, but my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 36. and when his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples aſked him after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, if he would at this time reſtore the kingdom to <hi>Iſrael:</hi> He anſwered them, it is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons which the father hath kept in his own power, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6, 7. yet I do believe, and have very much confidence, that the time is at hand; and it is yet but a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:184883:36"/> tarry, even ſo amen. But who will abide the day of his coming, and who will ſtand when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. and this I deſire to minde you by the way, that as at or in the beginning work of your deliverance, You muſt come in by weeping croſs, not onely in the ſight and ſenſe of your ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 4. Looking on him whom you have peirced, and mourning for him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. but likewiſe in relation to the great trouble you are like to meet with alſo from the world, that as you have been ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath been kept in obſcurity, ſo the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will rage in your gathering together, and then will be the firſt war of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. and 39. and it will go hard with you for a time, ſee <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 1, 2. to this that agreeth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. when the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> is dryed up, that the way of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:184883:36"/> the kings of the earth may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, <hi>verſ.</hi> 13, 14. on their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, three unclean ſpirits like frogs went out of the mouth of the dragon, the beaſt and the falſe prophets, which are the ſpirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth to the kings of the earth, and to the whole world to gather them together to the battel of the great day of God almighty; that is the great battel of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> mentioned before, called the great battel of God almighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is that great battle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, where he will deſtroy both his and your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>And in this great diſtreſs, by reaſon of the nations fury, called <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> then ſhall <hi>Michael</hi> the great prince of his people, ſtand up for your deliverance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. Then will the Lord ſend a fire upon <hi>Magog,</hi> and he ſhall
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:184883:37"/> know that there is a God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Lord will make his holy name known in the midſt of his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he will not let them pollute his holy name any more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 39. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And then ſhall that propheſie be fulfilled, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. and <hi>Micah</hi> 4. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more, onely after the glorious reign of Chriſt and his Saints, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhall be looſed for a little ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and ſhall gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> (that is thoſe that were left of the nations in the firſt deſtruction, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 2) and they ſhal compaſs the campe of the Saints about, &amp; the beloved City; &amp; fire ſhall come down from God and deſtroy them, this ſhall be the laſt encamping together of <hi>Gog,</hi> and the laſt deſtruction and final judgement; in this day of glory ſhall all believing Gentiles be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:184883:37"/> in with you, for he is given as well to be a light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as to be the glory of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 49. 6.</p>
               <p>Thus have I in tenderneſs and faithfulneſs both to the Lord and you, diſcharged this as my duty in commending theſe few lines unto you; the Lord grant that it may finde acceptance with you. Here are many prayers preſented for you at the throne of grace, by thoſe who clearly ſee and believe Gods intention of good to you; for my ſelf I truſt my heart is ſo much ſet at liberty towards you, that I could not onely proſtrate my pen and prayers for your good, but my perſon likewiſe, if I ſaw a clear call from the Lord to ſerve you.</p>
               <p>In a word to conclude, I do believe that you have ſome of thoſe remembrancers, in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſpoken of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 6, 7. That
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:184883:38"/> will give the Lord no reſt till he have made <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> a praiſe in the earth; which is the earneſt and daily prayer of him who is both yours and the truths ſervant, as far as he may, though unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</p>

            <head>THE POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>MY Friends, to whoſe hands this Epiſtle may come; The eſtate of the Jews having been a long time ſad, and indeed as once the Gentiles were, and all unbelieving Gentiles are, without Chriſt in the world, and ſo without hope in themſelves, as in relation to the true Meſſiah, the Lord having given me ſome apprehenſion concerning his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both of grace and glory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, I could not with good conſcience altogether hold my peace at this time, without writing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:184883:39"/> theſe preceding lines unto them; it being tranſlated into <hi>French</hi> (that being a language that they are exerciſed in) and ſo ſent unto them, the work being done, the iſſue I leave to the Lord, who I know doth uſually honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in working by weak means; and being deſired by ſome friends, I have likewiſe got it printed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thereby not onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke others, who perhaps may be more inlarged in this work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe poor dark deſpiſed people, but likewiſe that all whoſe hearts are (truely) Zion-ward, may be inſtant with the Lord in prayer for them, and ſo much the more, becauſe their coming in will be to us life from the dead; and their fulneſs will be our glory. Oh therefore let all be warned, not to be wiſe in their own conceit, and know that blindneſs is happened to <hi>Iſrael</hi> but in part, but that till
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:184883:39"/> the fulneſs of the Gentiles is come in, and then <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>I have a few words, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and friends, to preſent you farther with, concerning the reign of Chriſt; and that is, that he ſhall have a kingdom upon the earth, and ſhall reign with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the earth, manifeſting his power and glory amongſt them, and over the world.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſhall anſwer one objection, that is, ſome may ſay, <hi>It was not long ſince that your ſelf was against this principle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its true, in part I was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much informed in the truth of the reign of Chriſt, but judging it to be a glorious reign in the ſpirits of his people over the world, and this is the apprehenſion of many precious ſons of Zion at this day; but the Lord opening the ſeals by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:184883:40"/> degrees unto his people, he gives them to ſee farther into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his will concerning his kingdom, and as light ſhines in, their darkneſs doth flye away: I could not but judge it my duty to give ſome hints concerning my farther apprehenſion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, in which I ſhall be very brief.</p>
            <p>That his kingdom ſhall be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt on earth, will appear from theſe enſuing grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It was and is the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Father to exalt the Son here on earth before the ſons of men; this was his deſign before he made the world, and ever ſince all things, hath, doth, and will concur to the bringing about of this great deſign; therefore he at firſt made the world by him and for him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. afterwards man being faln, and the curſe come in upon the whole
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:184883:40"/> creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. God did by him and for him recover the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. that ſo he might have a ſelected people to himſelf, that might enjoy his grace and glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 4. His ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in the fleſh was a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to this great glory, both for himſelf and people, it being the appointment of the Father, and there being no other way left or appointed by the Father for the redemption of the ſons of men, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. he being aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 17. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive for himſelf a kingdom, and return, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. 15. and in the mean time by his Spirit in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, he is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together of his people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (among the Gentiles) that when he do appear, they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with him in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. for to them that look for him, he will
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:184883:41"/> appear a ſecond time without ſin to ſalvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. that God having made the world, and again redeemed it to a ſtate of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by his Son and for him, and purchaſed a people to himſelf out of the world. We may conclude that the Sons domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſhall be over the world: ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. throughout; and that all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him.</p>
            <div type="objection">
               <head>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> So they do ſerve him now, and he rules over them.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, they ſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God now, but the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt is not of this world; but there is a time appointed when the kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be viſibly manifeſt, and the world ſhall knowingly he ſubject to the Son, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
               <p>Second ground is, that this truth is clearly held forth in the Scriptures; of truth, when our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:184883:41"/> underſtandings are opened, we ſhall ſee it. The firſt Scripture I ſhall preſent you with, as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 27. Whom the heavens muſt receive until the time of the reſtitution of all things, which God hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his prophets ſince the world began, where we may note two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That at the coming of Chriſt from heaven will be the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not the diſſolution.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, it is that reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpoken of by the mouth of all the holy prophets.</p>
               <p>Now it will be good to ſearch into the prophets, and ſee what they have propheſied of, and we ſhall find all agree in one, that Chriſt muſt reign, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 6. 7. that his dominion ſhall be from ſea to ſea, even to the ends of the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. that he ſhall poſſeſs all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 8. that he ſhall reign
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:184883:42"/> in mount <hi>Zion</hi> and in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and before his ancients gloriouſly, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 23. that a king ſhall reign in righteouſneſs, and princes ſhall rule in judgement, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1. that God will raiſe unto <hi>David</hi> a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and execute judgement and juſtice in the earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5. and <hi>David</hi> my ſervant ſhall be king over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they ſhall dwell in the land which I gave to <hi>Jacob</hi> my ſervant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ezek. 37. 24, 25. and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 27. that the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 9.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many others I might produce to this purpoſe, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then will be the reſtitution or reſtoration of the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that Scripture will be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the letter as well as in ſpirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 9. <hi>chap.</hi> 65. 25. conſidered with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20, 21, 22.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:184883:42"/> and then ſhall thoſe bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be made good to the Saints here on earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. 8. and <hi>chap.</hi> 65. 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all this muſt be done when Jeſus Chriſt is ſent from heaven to manifeſt his power to take to himſelf his great kingdom, and to reign; and this is likewiſe confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the New Teſtament, the Nations and kingdoms of this world are become the Nations and kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. This is the thouſand yeers ſpoken of in <hi>chap.</hi> 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A third ground I take from his ſuffering, he fulfilled all that was propheſied of him concerning his ſuffering, according to the very letter of the Scriptures, he hath ſo fulfilled it, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 18. and why ſhould we think it incredible that he ſhall even ſo fulfill the Scripturs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:184883:43"/> in his reign on earth? And why ſhall we think it a high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcovery of grace for the Son to abaſe himſelf on earth in his humiliation, and think it too low a piece of ſervice for him to come and reign, to receive the due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert (if I may ſo ſay) of all his labour to manifeſt his glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Saints, and to ſet his feet on the necks of his enemies? Why ſhould we not think it to be a great degree of honour for the Lord who have ſuffered on earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his glory on the earth. And why ſhall we make an Alegory or myſtery of thoſe Scriptures that do foretell of his reign on earth, any more than of thoſe Scriptures that did foretell of his ſufferings, I do believe that it hath been the policy of Satan, and the weakneſs and pride of men, in turning Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture into Alegories and myſte-ſo much, that we had almoſt loſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:184883:43"/> the truth; therefore let it ſuffice, that as Chriſt and his people hath had their day of humiliation on the earth, ſo they ſhall have their exaltation on the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 26, 27. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. 5, 6, 7, 8.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. That is to make good the Scripture which ſaith, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. 5. The Lord our God ſhall come, and all the Saints with thee, and if they be not caught up to meet the Lord, he cannot bring them with him.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, the Scripture do not ſay that they ſhal abide above, but with the Lord, that is, they ſhall come down with him, as <hi>Joel</hi> 3. 11.</p>
